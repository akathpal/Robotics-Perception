HOW TO RUN CODE:

1) Run Main_Visual_Odometry.m (this file will load the matched points features which are saved to .mat file)
2) If you want to extract the features while running the code run Main_Visual_Odometry_1.m and extract the dataset in the input folder.
3) If you want to run Matlab implementation along with my code then uncomment the MATLAB implementation section. I already saved the points in location_mat.mat and i am plotting the output with matlab output and accumulated drift is also calculated.
