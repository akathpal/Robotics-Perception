1)PROJECT_VIDEO: Go to Code Directory and Run Main_Project.m file.

2)Challenge_Video: Run Main_Challenge.m file . I was able to only partially complete the challenge video. 
  I used slightly different approach for challenge video in comparison to project_video. I have mentioned
  the differences on Page6 and Page7 in Report.pdf.

3) Output:
   The video outputs for both project and challenge are in output directory.
   Output Challenge Video, Output Project Video
  
4) Run time for Main_Project file is around 550sec.
